Reward function, as a pure function of a state summary.

Pure on purpose: a "policy" in the tests is then just a hand-written list of
snapshots, so the reward can be validated with no environment, no simulator and
no training run. It also means those tests survive the batched env replacing the
PettingZoo stub, because they never depended on either.

Design rationale, weight-setting method and the known degenerate optima are in
docs/REWARD.md. The short version:

- The dominant term IS the headline metric (fraction of steps mission-capable),
  so the policy optimises exactly the number that gets reported.
- All *guidance* is potential-based (Ng, Harada & Russell 1999), which provably
  cannot move the optimum. A plain proximity bonus is a salary that grows with
  time loitering; PBRS pays once for real progress and round trips cancel.
- Weights are pinned by behavioural orderings, not swept. Only lambda is swept.

Everything is batched, pure torch, device-agnostic, free of .item()/.cpu().

    ## Why this component exists

    📏 Every other component of `Phi` reduces the swarm with a hard `min`
    (`nearest_dist_m`), a hard `max` (`best_clearance_m`) or the router's chosen
    path (`e2e_capacity_mbps`). So at any instant **`Phi` is a function of one
    drone and is exactly constant in the other four.** A drone that is not
    currently the nearest, the clearest or on the path can fly anywhere at all
    without moving the potential by a single bit -- and those are precisely the
    drones that have to pre-position for the relay chain and the handoff.

    The measured consequence, `scripts/measure_potential.py` on the eval split at
    stage 4: learned policies sit against the map boundary on **15-23 %** of
    steps against B0's **0.9 %**, and `off_axis_m` is **252 m** against B0's
    **105 m**. Out there the shipped potential is not weak, it is *absent*.

    ## The construction

    Sample `n_samples` points evenly along the segment, and ask how covered each
    one is:

        f_im    = 1 / (1 + (d_im / r_cover)^2)      drone i's cover of sample m
        covered = mean_m [ 1 - prod_i (1 - f_im) ]  soft OR over the swarm
        mustered= mean_i [ max_m f_im ]             each drone's own proximity
        Phi     = (covered + mustered) / 2

    Three properties, each of them the reason for a choice above:

    1. **Every drone always has a gradient.** The kernel is heavy-tailed
       (Cauchy, not Gaussian) *on purpose*: at 800 m and `r_cover = 262 m` it
       still reads 0.10 and still has slope. An exponential kernel -- or the hard
       `min` the shipped terms use -- is numerically zero out there, which is the
       failure this component exists to fix. A drone stranded at the map edge
       must be told to come back, and it is the far field that has to tell it.

    2. **It cannot be satisfied by clustering, and needs no agent index to do
       it.** `d cover_m / d f_jm = prod_{i != j} (1 - f_im)`: a drone's marginal
       value at a sample point is exactly *how uncovered that point is by
       everybody else*. Two drones in the same place are worth barely more than
       one; spreading along the axis is worth much more. That is a differentiated
       role pressure out of a **team** quantity with no `i` in it, which is what
       `docs/REWARD.md`'s homogeneity constraint requires and what
       `docs/BLOCK_G.md`'s per-drone `w_relay` could not produce.

    3. **Huddling at either end scores badly.** Samples run the whole segment, so
       five drones parked on the MCV cover the near end and nothing else. That is
       the failure mode a plain "distance to the MCV-HVT line" term would have --
       sitting *on* the MCV is distance zero.

    ⚠️ **Horizontal distance only.** The drones fly at 40-80 m and both endpoints
    are at ground level, so a 3D distance would add a near-constant offset and
    would quietly reward descending. Altitude is governed by the band, not here.

    # 0.03 per 8 m step against the objective's 0.054 -- and (b) it worked by
    # *removing* potential from a distant sightline rather than adding it to a
    # close one, which is why `w_hold = 1.0` discourages acquiring at all. Here
    # it is an ADDITIVE component with its own weight, so its per-step gradient

    # building seeing nothing while one 300 m down the street sees fine.
    #
    # ⚠️ The gate is the BOOLEAN, not the graded `observe` factor, and a test

    ## The measured deficit this exists for

    `scripts/probe_credit.py`: the critic is handed one global state repeated per
    drone, so `max |V_i - V_j| = 0.000e+00`, and the reward is team-dominated --
    which leaves **0.015-0.06 %** of advantage variance distinguishing one drone
    from another. Every drone's policy gradient is
    `grad log pi(a_i | o_i) * A` with the *same* `A`: each is told *the team did
    well*, never *your action was the good one*. Role differentiation cannot be
    learned from a signal that is constant across the agents it would
    differentiate.

    ## ⚠️ Why ONLY the relay term goes per-drone

    `docs/REWARD.md` warns that per-drone potentials cluster the swarm: pay every
    drone for its own proximity or its own sightline and all `N` fly at the HVT
    and nobody relays. **That warning is correct and this respects it** --
    `Phi_approach` and `Phi_observe` stay TEAM quantities, so once one drone has
    the target the pull stops for everyone else, exactly as before.

    `on_path` is the opposite kind of quantity. A drone can only be on the
    delivery path by sitting *between* the source and the MCV, so paying for it
    rewards **spreading out**, not clustering. And it is the role with no signal
    at all today: measured on the eval split, conditioned on observing, every
    learned policy's chain is indistinguishable from a random policy's
    (1.86-1.91 hops against random's 1.83, B0's 2.26).

    ## Sizing, which is NOT free even though the optimum is

    PBRS makes any `Phi` optimum-preserving -- in the multi-agent case too
    (Devlin & Kudenko, 2011), so this cannot move the equilibrium. **But
    optimum-preserving is not signal-preserving.** `probe_credit.py` measured a
    condition where 50 % of *reward* variance was per-drone and the advantage
    still washed it out to 0.06 %: GAE accumulates the team component coherently
    over ~19 effective steps (`lambda = 0.95`) while per-drone terms largely
    cancel. A per-drone term has to clear that filter before it reaches the
    gradient.

    The payment is concentrated at transitions, which is the intent: joining the
    path pays `~k*w_relay` once, holding it pays only the `(gamma - 1)*Phi` decay,
    and joining-then-leaving nets zero. So the incentive is *take a relay slot and
    keep it* -- precisely the commitment the swarm does not currently make.
    At `k = 10`, `w_relay = 0.2` makes joining the chain worth two steps of full
    mission capability. **0.2-0.5 is the range to test; 0.0 ships.**

    ⚠️ The acceptance test is `probe_credit.py`'s **advantage** column, not its
    value column. If the between-drone share does not rise, the term is not
    reaching the gradient and its weight is too small -- the one honest reason to
    raise it.
