"""Batched env core -- Block D.

The training path. Carries a leading `num_envs` dimension and never leaves the
GPU: no `.item()`, no `.cpu()`, no Python loop over environments. `swarm_env.py`
is the thin PettingZoo adapter over this, for API-compliance tests and visual
debugging only (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`).

Node layout -- two sets, deliberately different sizes. Confusing them feeds the
HVT into the routing DP as a relay:

    geometric  K = N + 2     0..N-1 drones,  N = MCV,  N+1 = HVT
    radio      R = N + 1     0..N-1 drones,  N = MCV

Occlusion runs over all K, so the drone-HVT rays serve the sensor *and* the
jammer path from one call. The HVT is never a radio node: it is the target and
the emitter, not a relay.

Two conventions that are easy to get backwards and are pinned by tests:

**Reward timing.** `reward.episode_return` pairs consecutive snapshots as
`reward(s_t, s_t+1)`, so the objective terms are evaluated at the state the
transition *starts* from and only the shaping looks forward. `step()` therefore
keeps the pre-transition snapshot in `self.snap` and calls `reward(self.snap,
new_snap)`. Energy is charged on the same one-step lag, which is why the battery
drain and the reward's energy term are consistent in aggregate over an episode
rather than step by step.

**The snapshot after an auto-reset.** `gamma*Phi(s') - Phi(s)` needs `Phi` of the
*fresh* state on the first step of every new episode. Zeroing it instead would
leave `gamma*Phi(s_1)` in the telescoped return, which is policy-dependent and
so breaks exactly the invariance PBRS is chosen for. `step()` therefore
evaluates the physics a second time after resetting. That second pass also
produces the observation that auto-reset must return, so it is the price of the
API rather than of the reward -- and at ~3170x margin on the throughput gate
(`docs/BLOCK_C.md`) the 2x is affordable.

        """**Velocity setpoints**, tracked by a rate-limited airframe.

        `docs/REDUCTION.md` task 1. The action is a desired velocity in
        `[-1, 1]^3`, scaled by the dash speed. The airframe then closes on it
        subject to its acceleration envelope -- which is what PX4 and ArduPilot
        offboard control actually consume over MAVLink, and what `PLAN.md` lists
        as contribution C3.

        ## Why this is the more faithful interface, and not merely a nicer one

        📏 B0 does not solve the problem the learner was being handed. It
        computes a **desired velocity** and converts it to acceleration with a
        proportional servo at the last moment (`b0.py`). Commanding raw
        acceleration hands the learner a double integrator with saturation and
        makes it discover that inner loop from reward alone. Measured
        consequence, eval split, deterministic policy: the learned policy sat at
        the 25 m/s dash cap on **57 %** of steps and against the map boundary on
        **23 %**, where B0 scores 3.1 % and 0.9 %.

        🔒 **The acceleration envelope is kept, as a property of the airframe
        rather than of the action.** Removing it would let a drone reverse from
        +25 to −25 m/s inside one 0.4 s tick, and it is what `energy.py`'s
        control-effort term and the reward's `effort` term consume. At
        `MAX_ACCEL_MS2 = 10` and `dt = 0.4` the airframe closes at most **4 m/s
        of velocity error per tick**, so rest to dash still takes ~6 ticks. The
        policy chooses *where it wants to be going*; it no longer has to
        integrate.

        ⚠️ **The rate limit is per component, matching the convention this env
        already used** -- the old code scaled each action component independently
        by `MAX_ACCEL_MS2`, so a diagonal command always had up to `sqrt(3)x` the
        axis limit. Keeping that convention is what makes B0 **bit-identical**
        across this change (`test_core.py`), which in turn is what keeps every
        inherited B0 number valid. A norm limit would be marginally more physical
        and would silently move the baseline.

        **`true` is the world and `channel` is the model of it.** The sensor,
        the reward's observation potential and every diagnostic read `true` at
        every rung; only `_capacity` and the channel-derived observation
        features read `channel`. That split is docs/BLOCK_F.md decisions 1 and 2
        and it is what keeps RQ1 interpretable:

        - if the sensor were gated, F0 would be *a city with no buildings* and
          the F0->F1 gap would conflate sensor occlusion with link occlusion --
          and Block E measured those at wildly different sizes (observation is
          ~93 % solved by geometry while the chain binds), so the larger,
          uninteresting effect would swamp the smaller, interesting one;
        - if `chain_occluded` were gated it would read 0.0 % under F0 *by
          construction*, destroying the headline failure-attribution metric in
          the one condition it exists to expose.

        The two are the same tensor whenever the rung models occlusion, so the
        split costs an allocation at F0 and nothing anywhere else. Occlusion
        itself runs at every rung, which is why **no rung is cheaper to
        simulate** -- good for the budget and good for comparability, since a
        faster rung would quietly get more samples per GPU-hour.

        Only this kernel is compiled, not `step()`. Two independent reasons,
        both measured at D1 and both to be re-checked on CUDA:

        - `fullgraph=True` over `step()` fails with "failed to convert
          args/kwargs to proxy" -- dynamo cannot proxy the `torch.Generator`
          that `_sample_episode` uses. Dropping the generator would fix it but
          would cost per-seed reproducibility, which is worth more than fusing
          stages that are 0.3 % of the cost.
        - Inductor's Metal backend then fails to codegen the whole step at all
          (`float64 cast requested`; MPS has no fp64). CUDA/Triton is a
          different backend and is expected to be fine, but that is untested.

        Since occlusion is 99.7 % of the eager step, compiling it alone captures
        essentially all the available speedup anyway.

        """Actor-local views plus the critic's global state.

        The actor may only see what a real drone could sense or receive; global
        state belongs to the critic. Violating that turns decentralized execution
        into centralized execution and invalidates CTDE (docs/ENVIRONMENT.md).

        Three of the 108 dims are **channel state** rather than sensing, and they
        report the channel model in force -- the measured noise floor, the
        clearance margin on the link to the MCV, and the per-edge clearance
        margin. The other three channel-derived features (`on_path`, e2e
        capacity, per-edge capacity) follow the rung for free, since they are
        computed from its capacity matrix.

        The rule, in one line: **sensor features report the sensor, channel
        features report the channel model, diagnostics report the truth.**

        Why gate them at all -- docs/BLOCK_F.md decisions 1 and 2 settle the
        sensor and the diagnostics but not this, and it is their third sibling.
        A radius simulator has no building data to put in an observation, so
        reporting true clearance under F0 would be reporting a quantity that
        model does not possess. Worse, it would leave F0's observation
        *internally contradictory* -- an edge reporting 74 Mbps beside a
        clearance feature reading -150 m -- and that contradiction is learnable
        in exactly the direction that would understate the F0->F1 gap RQ1 exists
        to measure. It is not hypothetical: B0's link repair hill-climbs on
        these two features, and ungated it would keep repairing against
        buildings the channel never charges it for.
