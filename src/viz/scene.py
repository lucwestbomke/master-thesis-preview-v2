"""Static scene drawing shared by the inspection and presentation front ends.

one rule this file exists to protect: **draw the oriented boxes the env
consumes, never the source polygons**, so what is on screen is what occlusion
tests against. `source_footprints` is the deliberate exception and is drawn as
an overlay, for judging the approximation rather than for trusting it.
