"""B0 -- the scripted geometric baseline. Block E.

THESIS_PLAN §3 calls B0 "the non-learned control: relays placed on the MCV->HVT
geodesic, one observer". `docs/MODELS.md` turns that into a requirement -- every
architecture must at least match it -- so B0 is not a formality. **A weak B0
flatters every result in Chapter 6 and is the first thing an examiner attacks.**

The information contract, which is the decision that sets what the headline
comparison means (`docs/BLOCK_E.md` §1):

    B0 is a pure function of `obs["flat"]` and its own carried state.

It never reads `env.hvt_pos`, `env.boxes` or any other env attribute -- it sees
exactly the `(B, N, 108)` tensor Block G's actors see, so "MARL earns its keep"
becomes a statement about *control* with information held fixed. The `oracle`
variant is the deliberate exception and takes ground truth through an explicit
argument to `act()`, so it cannot be acquired by accident. `test_b0.py` pins the
contract by feeding identical observations from two differently-seeded envs.

Two advantages B0 is granted on purpose, both stated in the write-up rather than
hidden: it carries **memory** (Block G's actors are feed-forward), and it takes
**roles from the agent index** (Block G's actors are homogeneous so that roles
must emerge). A scripted controller is programmed per airframe; both are what a
real one would do, and both make B0 harder to beat.

What it may *not* do: gossip the target's coordinates. The neighbour channel
carries a `sees_hvt` **bit**, not the observer's fix, because sharing the fix
would dissolve RQ3's coordination problem. B0 inherits that restriction, or it
would have a communication channel the learned policies do not.

Why that costs less than it looks: **the relays do not need the target, they need
the observer**, whose relative position is in the observation exactly, every
step. Only the observer and the spares need a target estimate -- and the
observer, by definition of its role, is looking at it.

The variant ladder (`VARIANTS`), which is how the design effort is made visible
rather than asserted:

    geodesic  THESIS_PLAN's literal sketch, built properly: velocity servo,
              80 m, adaptive hop count, roles fixed by index
    b0        + ranked roles from the sees bits, target-belief filter with
              dead reckoning, spare observation posts, local link repair
    oracle    + ground-truth target state. A stated upper bound, not the
              headline; the b0->oracle gap measures what target information is
              worth in this task

        that loop into the airframe, where it belongs and where the *learner* now
        gets it for free, so B0 simply says how fast it wants to go.

        📏 **The two are exactly equivalent, and that is load-bearing.** The env
        clamps the velocity error per component to `MAX_ACCEL_MS2 * dt`, so

        comparison in the thesis moves with it.

        `own_vel` is gone from the signature deliberately: B0 no longer needs to
        know its own velocity to command motion, which is precisely the asymmetry
        `REDUCTION` task 1 removed between B0 and the learner.
