"""Measure `Phi` over the states a policy actually visits -- the instrument the
`Phi` rebuild is judged on.

Every `Phi`-side intervention in Block G so far was sized by intuition and
returned a null, and `docs/REWARD.md` eventually explained why: measured across
the whole operating band the shipped potential moves a **total of 0.32**, while
the objective's energy term pays **0.054 per step** to cruise rather than hold
station. The shaping was not badly tuned, it was switched off.

That comparison is the only one that matters, and nothing in this repo could
compute it. This script does:

1. **Bank the states.** Roll a policy through the real env and keep exactly the
   fields `reward.potential` reads -- `nearest_dist_m`, `best_clearance_m`,
   `observer_dist_m`, `e2e_capacity_mbps` -- plus the diagnostics that say where
   in the band each step sat. Read straight off `env.snap`, so this measures the
   potential the env computes rather than a reimplementation of it.
2. **Score a candidate.** Evaluate any `RewardWeights` over the bank and report
   the two numbers a design target can be written in:
   * **swing** -- `p99 - p1` of `Phi` across visited states, and
   * **per-step gradient** -- the distribution of `|Phi(s_t+1) - Phi(s_t)|`,
     against `ENERGY_STEP_DIFFERENTIAL = 0.054`.

⚠️ A bank is device- and policy-specific. `torch.Generator` streams differ per
device, so a bank collected on MPS is not comparable with one collected on CUDA
-- the physics is identical, the episodes are not.
